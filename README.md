# Python Challenge
## How to Run
Pull the repository and make sure you have the geoip2 python package installed. The .exe file is located in dist called ipFinder.
## Instructions
- Once the app is running simply click the Browse button to search for a file to extract IPs from.
- When a file is selected you can extract just the IP adresses from the file by clicking the Find File IPs button.
- If you would like to extract IPs and their Geo Location information click the show Geo Location box and then the Find file IPs.
- To filter the results type the exact result you are looking for in one of the search credential boxes and click the Filter button.
## Filter Component
Filter component is incomplete. When filtering city, state and country, input needs to be exact or else the program will return IP not found. Refined searches also need some work.
